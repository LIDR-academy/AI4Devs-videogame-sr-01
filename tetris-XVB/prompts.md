# üß† Tetris Game Development with AI & Cursor IDE

This document contains a structured set of AI prompts to guide the development of a browser-based Tetris game using Cursor IDE and AI assistance.

---

## üéÆ 1. Game Overview

```
Act as a researcher. Search reliable sources about the game Tetris. Provide a concise summary including:
- Game origin and creator
- Basic rules and core gameplay loop
- Scoring mechanics
- Popular variants (e.g. Tetris 99, Tetris Effect)
Output the result in well-structured Markdown under the heading: "Game Overview"
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Technical Requirements

```
As a senior game developer, define the technical requirements to develop a browser-based version of Tetris.
Include:
- Programming language(s) and framework(s) (e.g. TypeScript, HTML5 Canvas)
- Minimum browser compatibility
- Resolution and performance expectations
- Input handling (keyboard/mouse)
Output as a requirements checklist in Markdown format.
```

---

## üß© 3. Game Components

```
List and describe the core components needed to build a Tetris game. For each component, specify:
- Name and purpose (e.g. "Board", "Tetromino", "Game Loop")
- Key methods or attributes
- Dependencies or interactions with other components
Present the result as a component diagram in text or a table format.
```

---

## üïπÔ∏è 4. Functionality

```
Describe in detail the main gameplay functionality of Tetris:
- Game loop: update, draw, input handling
- Tetromino logic: spawn, move, rotate, collide, lock
- Line clearing and scoring
- Leveling and speed increase
- Game over condition
Output code-ready pseudocode or bullet points that can be translated into TypeScript.
```

---

## üé® 5. Styling (UI/UX)

```
Design a clean and minimal UI/UX for a Tetris game using HTML/CSS.
Include:
- Game board styling
- Score, level, and lines-cleared panels
- Next Tetromino preview
- Responsive layout suggestions
Generate HTML/CSS code snippets where relevant.
```

---

## ‚ö° 6. Optimization

```
Suggest performance optimizations for a browser-based Tetris game:
- Efficient rendering with HTML5 Canvas
- Memory management (e.g. object reuse, array clearing)
- Frame rate stability (e.g. requestAnimationFrame)
- Input debounce or throttling
Output a list of best practices with short explanations.
```

---

## ‚úÖ 7. Testing

```
Propose a test plan for a Tetris game implemented in TypeScript.
Include:
- Unit tests (e.g. tetromino collision, line clearing logic)
- Integration tests (e.g. score updates)
- UI tests (e.g. keypresses trigger correct actions)
Mention suitable testing frameworks (e.g. Jest, Playwright).
Provide examples of test cases in pseudocode or real code.
```

Ask before executing each step and also ask about any doubts that arise.

eliverable: A single HTML file containing all necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the Snake game. Include inline comments to explain key parts of the game's code and logic.

Please prioritize functionality, readability of code, and adherence to the game specifications outlined above. This project serves as a comprehensive exercise in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML integration, aiming to showcase proficiency in creating interactive web-based games.
