# Conway's Game of Life - Development Plan

## Overview

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John
Conway. It's a zero-player game where the evolution is determined by its initial
state, requiring no further input.

## Phase 1: Design & Architecture

### 1.1 Game Rules Analysis

- **Birth**: A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive
- **Survival**: A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive
- **Death**: All other cells die or remain dead

### 1.2 Core Components Design

- **Grid System**: 2D array representing the game board
- **Cell States**: Boolean values (alive/dead)
- **Neighbor Calculation**: Algorithm to count adjacent cells
- **Generation Engine**: Apply rules to create next generation
- **Renderer**: Visual representation of the grid

### 1.3 User Interface Design

- **Control Panel**: Start/Stop, Reset, Speed control
- **Grid Display**: Interactive canvas or HTML grid
- **Pattern Selector**: Predefined patterns (Glider, Blinker, etc.)
- **Statistics**: Generation counter, population count

## Phase 2: Core Implementation

### 2.1 HTML Structure

- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Canvas element for grid rendering
- Control buttons and inputs
- Information display areas

### 2.2 Grid Management System

- Initialize grid with configurable dimensions
- Cell state management (alive/dead)
- Efficient neighbor counting algorithm
- Grid boundary handling (wrap-around or fixed)

### 2.3 Game Logic Engine

- Rule application function
- Generation advancement
- State transition management
- Performance optimization for large grids

## Phase 3: User Interface & Interaction

### 3.1 Visual Rendering

- Canvas-based rendering for performance
- Cell visualization (colors, shapes)
- Grid lines and boundaries
- Smooth animations between generations

### 3.2 User Controls

- Play/Pause functionality
- Step-by-step advancement
- Speed adjustment (generations per second)
- Grid size configuration
- Clear/Reset functionality

### 3.3 Interactive Features

- Click to toggle cell states
- Drag to paint cells
- Pattern insertion at cursor position
- Save/Load grid states

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### 4.1 Predefined Patterns

- Common patterns library (Glider, Blinker, Toad, etc.)
- Pattern preview system
- One-click pattern insertion
- Pattern rotation and flipping

### 4.2 Performance Optimization

- Efficient algorithms for large grids
- Only update changed regions
- Optimized neighbor calculation
- Memory usage optimization

### 4.3 Quality of Life Features

- Zoom in/out functionality
- Pan around large grids
- Generation statistics
- Population graphs over time

## Phase 5: Testing & Polish

### 5.1 Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for game rules
- Integration tests for UI components
- Performance benchmarks
- Cross-browser compatibility

### 5.2 Code Quality

- Clean, readable code structure
- Proper error handling
- Code documentation
- Performance profiling

### 5.3 User Experience

- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Intuitive controls and feedback
- Loading states and transitions
- Help/tutorial system

## Technical Specifications

### Grid System

- **Default Size**: 50x50 cells
- **Maximum Size**: 100x100 cells
- **Cell Size**: 8-12 pixels
- **Boundary**: Toroidal wrap-around

### Performance Targets

- **Smooth Animation**: 60 FPS for grids up to 50x50
- **Large Grid Support**: 30 FPS for 100x100 grids
- **Memory Usage**: < 10MB for maximum grid size

### Browser Support

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ES6+ features allowed
- No external dependencies

## Development Methodology

### 1. Test-Driven Development

- Write tests for core game rules first
- Implement features to pass tests
- Refactor with confidence

### 2. Incremental Development

- Start with basic grid and rules
- Add features one at a time
- Test thoroughly at each step

### 3. Performance-First Approach

- Profile early and often
- Optimize algorithms before adding features
- Monitor memory usage

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- Correctly implements Conway's Game of Life rules
- Interactive grid with clickable cells
- Play/pause/step controls
- Speed adjustment
- Pattern library with common shapes
- Reset functionality

### Performance Requirements

- Smooth animation on 50x50 grid
- Responsive UI on desktop and mobile
- Fast pattern recognition and insertion
- Efficient memory usage

### User Experience Requirements

- Intuitive and clean interface
- Immediate visual feedback
- Educational value (shows mathematical beauty)
- Engaging and interactive

## Next Steps

1. **Set up project structure** - Create all necessary files
2. **Implement core grid system** - Basic 2D array management
3. **Add game rule logic** - Neighbor counting and state transitions
4. **Create basic UI** - HTML structure and CSS styling
5. **Add rendering system** - Canvas-based grid visualization
6. **Implement user controls** - Play/pause/step functionality
7. **Add interactivity** - Click to toggle cells
8. **Create pattern library** - Predefined shapes and patterns
9. **Optimize performance** - Efficient algorithms and rendering
10. **Polish and test** - Final testing and refinements

This plan provides a structured approach to building a robust, performant, and
user-friendly Conway's Game of Life implementation using vanilla JavaScript,
HTML, and CSS.
